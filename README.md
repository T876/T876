### Full-Stack Software Engineer

I am a results-driven Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience designing, architecting, and deploying scalable web applications. I specialize in building robust backend systems and intuitive frontend interfaces, with a proven ability to translate complex business requirements into high-quality, maintainable code.

My approach is grounded in a strong understanding of software architecture and a "plan-then-act" methodology‚Äîoften enhanced with AI-assisted workflows‚Äîto ensure the solutions I build are both efficient and scalable.
